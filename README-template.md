## Overview
It's a REVIEW PAGE  with 03 compnents 
- Title 
- Stars 
- Comments 

## My process
I built firstly the entire HTML file then I style it with CSS with some help of SASS too then I specified all specific part of **MEDIA QUERIES** settings 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS 


### What I learned

I learnt how to make the design more responsive and fit all devices by using **MEDIA QUERIES**

### Continued development
For me MEDIA QUERY was really chanllenging for me because I was focusing just on the given layouts while the design was not working on many other devices but now I feel that I did well in this challenge by laking it really responsive ... I am wondering to develop my knowledge on JAVASCRIPT especially in [MOBILE-NAV-BAR]!!!


### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to pick up different font styles ... :)
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand uses of some tags and properties in HTML & CSS (even in jS). I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
